# The Problem with UI Frameworks

Current UI frameworks are built for a world that's rapidly disappearing. They're designed around a simple assumption: UIs are just views into data. You fetch some data, transform it, and show it to users. But this model breaks down completely when we try to build AI-native applications.

Why? Because AI isn't just another data source - it fundamentally changes how applications work:

- Traditional apps are deterministic, AI apps are probabilistic
- Traditional apps work with data, AI apps work with meaning
- Traditional apps are modal, AI apps are multi-modal
- Traditional apps are client-server, AI apps need to run anywhere

## A Different Approach

While exploring this problem, we found inspiration in an unexpected place: Vim. Not just for its buffer/window model, but for its powerful modal approach. Think about it - in Vim, you seamlessly switch between modes for different tasks. Insert mode for typing, normal mode for navigation, visual mode for selection. This maps perfectly to modern applications - imagine switching your entire UI into a keyboard navigation mode, where every component responds differently based on the current mode. The separation of content (buffers) and view (windows) is just the start.

In Vim, a buffer holds content that can be viewed in multiple windows, each showing the content differently. This simple idea turns out to be incredibly powerful for AI applications:

- A buffer can hold any type of content (text, code, images, embeddings)
- Multiple windows can show different views of the same content
- Views can update in real-time as content changes
- Content can be transformed without affecting views

## Enter Effect

We needed a way to make this vision real. Traditional reactive libraries weren't enough - we needed something that could handle:
- Resource management for AI models
- Type-safe communication between components
- Clean error handling
- Cancellation and cleanup

Effect.ts turned out to be perfect for this. It's not just a library - it's a new way of thinking about applications that aligns perfectly with our needs.

## The Core Idea

What if we could build applications as networks of specialized widgets that:
- Can run anywhere (browser, server, GPU cluster)
- Communicate through typed streams
- Handle any type of content
- Transform and combine seamlessly

This is Kontrol. Not another UI framework, but a new way to build applications for the AI era.

## The Cool Part

The cool part isn't any individual feature - it's how natural everything feels when you put it all together. Want to add AI features? Just add a widget. Need more processing power? Move widgets to better hardware. Everything just works.

This document is the start of our story. In the next chapters, we'll explore:
- How widgets communicate across boundaries
- How buffers and windows really work
- How Effect powers everything
- What becomes possible with this approach
