# Kontrol: UI Framework for AI-Native Applications

## Vision
Kontrol is building the foundational UI framework for AI-native applications. While current tools force AI into traditional UI paradigms, we're creating primitives that enable entirely new ways of interacting with AI systems.

## Core Principles
1. **AI-First**: Built for AI-native applications from the ground up
2. **Multi-Modal**: Seamless integration of text, code, images, audio, and 3D
3. **Semantic**: Everything has meaning and relationships
4. **Spatial**: Ready for the future of computing
5. **Composable**: Build complex applications from simple primitives

## Example Applications
