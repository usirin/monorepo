# RFC 007: Spellbook Command System

## Summary
A type-safe, composable command system that serves as the central entry point for studio applications. This system provides a unified way to define, validate, and execute commands across the application while maintaining full type safety and runtime validation.

## Background and Motivation

### Current State
- Studio applications currently lack a centralized command system
- Command implementations are scattered across different modules
- No standardized way to validate command inputs
- Type safety is inconsistent across command implementations
- Difficult to discover available commands

### Pain Points
- Inconsistent command interfaces
- Runtime errors due to invalid command arguments
- Poor developer experience when implementing new commands
- Difficulty in maintaining command documentation
- No centralized way to track command usage

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. Command Definition
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'
import { defineCommand, createCommands } from '@umut/spellbook'

const workspaceCommands = defineCommand(
  'workspace',
  {
    create: defineCommand(
      'create',
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        template: z.enum(['empty', 'react', 'vue']).default('empty')
      }),
      async ({ name, template }) => {
        // Implementation
      }
    )
  }
)
```

2. Command Registration and Execution
```typescript
const commands = createCommands()
commands.register(workspaceCommands)

// Type-safe execution
await commands.execute('workspace.create', {
  name: 'my-app',
  template: 'react'
})
```

3. Command Discovery
```typescript
function CommandPalette() {
  const allCommands = commands.getAll()
  return (
    <div>
      {allCommands.map(command => (
        <div key={command.path}>
          {command.path}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Data Model
- Commands are organized in a tree structure
- Each command has a path, schema, and handler
- Schemas are defined using Zod for runtime validation
- Full TypeScript inference for command arguments

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Event Bus System
Pros:
- Looser coupling between components
- Easier to add new subscribers

Cons:
- No type safety for event payloads
- No centralized command discovery
- Harder to track command execution

### 2. Class-based Command Pattern
Pros:
- Traditional OOP approach
- Explicit command classes

Cons:
- More boilerplate
- Less flexible composition
- Harder to maintain type safety

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
1. Implement basic command definition and execution
2. Add type inference system
3. Implement command registration

### Phase 2: Developer Experience
1. Add command discovery API
2. Implement command palette UI
3. Add developer tools for command inspection

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Migrate existing commands to new system
2. Add telemetry and monitoring
3. Document migration guides

## Additional Considerations

### Security
- Commands should be authenticated where necessary
- Validate all inputs at runtime
- Consider command permissions system

### Performance
- Lazy load command implementations
- Cache command validation results
- Optimize command tree traversal

### Testing
- Each command should have unit tests
- Test invalid inputs
- Test command composition
- Test type inference

### Monitoring
- Track command execution times
- Monitor command failure rates
- Track command usage patterns

## Success Metrics
1. 100% type safety for command arguments
2. Zero runtime errors from invalid command arguments
3. Reduced time to implement new commands
4. Improved command discovery
